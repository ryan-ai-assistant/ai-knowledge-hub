# AI Knowledge Hub

This is your private, single source of truth for prompts, modules, templates, frameworks, and research.
It is designed for **Mode C (Act & Assemble)** via the ChatGPT GitHub connector.

> Tip: In ChatGPT, you can say things like:
> - "Write an external meeting summary for {district_name} using my hub."
> - "Draft a reminder email for the PD session next week; include resources; Lisa Damour tone."
> - "Create a session recap for today's event; pull the meeting-recap structure and professional tone."

## Structure
See the folder tree below. The **catalog** is auto-generated by a GitHub Action on each push.

- `prompts/` – ready-to-use prompts (with placeholders)
- `prompts/_modules/` – tone, structure, style, disclaimers
- `prompts/_patterns/` – shared patterns and parameter definitions
- `templates/` – document/email/Slack templates you generate frequently
- `frameworks/` – reusable thinking structures (process, steps, artifacts)
- `research/` – paper summaries, references
- `stubs/` – filenames that point to content stored elsewhere (e.g., ChatGPT uploads)
- `catalog/` – auto-generated index (JSON) for semantic retrieval
- `LOADER.md` – instructions for the assistant to assemble content on request

## Catalog (Auto-Generated)
This section will be updated by the workflow.
