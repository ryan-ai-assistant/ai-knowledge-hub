What it does: Creates a clear role definition that guides all of the Project’s responses

When to use it: Starting any new Claude Project, before you add any knowledge or instructions

The Prompt:

I’m creating a Claude Project for [SPECIFIC BUSINESS FUNCTION]. Help me define its core role.

Answer these questions in a structured format I can use as the foundation:
1. Primary function (what does this assistant DO)
2. Key responsibilities (3-5 specific tasks)
3. Decision-making authority (what can it decide vs. what needs my input)
4. Success metrics (how do I know it’s working)
5. Boundaries (what it should NOT do or handle)

My business context: [YOUR INDUSTRY/COMPANY]
This assistant will primarily help with: [MAIN USE CASE]
How to use it:

Replace [SPECIFIC BUSINESS FUNCTION] with your actual need (e.g., “sales outreach,” “content editing,” “competitive research”)

Fill in your industry and main use case

Copy the output directly into your Project’s planning document

Example input:

“I’m creating a Claude Project for social media content creation. Help me define its core role.

Answer these questions in a structured format I can use as the foundation:

Primary function (what does this assistant DO)

Key responsibilities (3-5 specific tasks)

Decision-making authority (what it can decide vs. what needs my input)

Success metrics (how do I know it’s working)

Boundaries (what it should NOT do or handle)

My business context: B2B SaaS company selling project management tools. This assistant will primarily help with: Creating LinkedIn posts and Twitter threads.”

What you’ll get: A structured role definition covering function, responsibilities, decision authority, success metrics, and boundaries

Pro tip: Keep this document in your Project’s knowledge base as “assistant_role.md” - Claude will reference it automatically in every conversation.

What it does: Converts your role definition into actual custom instructions Claude understands

When to use it: Right after defining the role, before you start using the Project

The Prompt:

Convert this role definition into custom instructions for a Claude Project:

[PASTE YOUR ROLE DEFINITION FROM PROMPT #1]

Format the instructions as:
- Clear “You are” statements defining identity
- Specific response patterns (how to structure outputs)
- Tone and style requirements
- Default behaviors (what to do without being asked)
- Constraints (what to avoid)

Make instructions specific enough that someone else could use this Project and get consistent results.
How to use it:

Copy your role definition from Prompt #1

Paste it into the prompt

Take the output and add it to your Project’s custom instructions field

Example input:

“Convert this role definition into custom instructions for a Claude Project:

Primary function: Create engaging LinkedIn and Twitter content for B2B SaaS audience Key responsibilities: Draft posts, suggest hooks, optimize for engagement, repurpose content Decision authority: Can choose formats and hooks; needs approval on claims about product features Success metrics: Posts require minimal editing, hooks generate clicks, tone matches brand Boundaries: No promotional spam, no unverified claims, no engagement bait tactics”

What you’ll get: Formatted custom instructions ready to paste into your Project settings

Pro tip: Test the instructions in 3-4 conversations before finalizing them. You’ll spot gaps fast.

What it does: Identifies exactly what documents and data your Project needs to be effective

When to use it: Before uploading files randomly—this prevents knowledge base bloat

The Prompt:

I’m building a Claude Project for [ROLE/FUNCTION]. Help me identify the essential knowledge base documents.

Current role: [PASTE ROLE FROM PROMPT #1]

Create a prioritized list:

TIER 1 - Critical (Project can’t function without these):
- Document type
- Why essential
- Update frequency

TIER 2 - Important (Significantly improves output):
- Document type  
- Why valuable
- Update frequency

TIER 3 - Optional (Nice to have):
- Document type
- Benefit
- Update frequency

Include document naming conventions and organization structure.
How to use it:

Fill in your role/function

Paste your role definition from Prompt #1

Use the output as your upload checklist

Example input:

“I’m building a Claude Project for social media content creation. Help me identify the essential knowledge base documents.

Current role: Create engaging LinkedIn and Twitter content for a B2B SaaS audience selling project management tools.”

What you’ll get: Prioritized list of exactly what documents to upload, organized by importance and update frequency

Pro tip: Start with only Tier 1 documents. Add Tier 2 after you’ve used the Project for a week and know what’s actually missing.

What it does: Creates click-and-go prompts that appear when you open your Project

When to use it: After your custom instructions are set—these become your quick-launch buttons

               GPT-5 Prompting Guide: Best Practices for General Usage
Introduction
GPT-5 represents a significant shift in how language models process and respond to prompts. Unlike previous models, GPT-5 is particularly sensitive to instruction structure, style, and tone. This guide extrapolates from coding-specific behaviors to provide comprehensive prompting strategies for all use cases.

Core Principles
1. Susceptibility to Instruction Style
GPT-5 is highly responsive to how you structure your prompts:

Be explicit about tone and style - The model adapts strongly to the communication style you establish
Use consistent formatting - Maintain uniform structure throughout your prompts
Define expectations clearly - GPT-5 performs better with well-defined parameters
2. Planning Before Execution
GPT-5 excels when given explicit planning phases:

Before responding, please:
1. Decompose the request into core components
2. Identify any ambiguities that need clarification
3. Create a structured approach to address each component
4. Validate your understanding before proceeding
Structured Prompting Techniques
The Spec Format
Define clear specifications for any behavior you want GPT-5 to follow:

<task_spec>
  Definition: [What exactly you want accomplished]
  When Required: [Conditions that trigger this behavior]
  Format & Style: [How the output should be structured]
  Sequence: [Step-by-step order of operations]
  Prohibited: [What to avoid]
  Handling Ambiguity: [How to deal with unclear inputs]
</task_spec>
Reasoning and Validation Steps
Always include these sections in complex prompts:

Pre-execution Reasoning: "Before starting, explain your understanding of the task and your approach"
Planning Phase: "Create a detailed plan with all sub-tasks identified"
Validation Checkpoints: "After each major step, verify the output meets requirements"
Post-action Review: "Confirm all objectives have been met before concluding"
Agentic Behavior Enhancement
Complete Task Resolution
For tasks requiring multiple steps or decisions:

Remember: Continue working until the entire request is fully resolved. 
- Decompose the query into ALL required sub-tasks
- Confirm each sub-task is completed before moving on
- Only conclude when you're certain the problem is fully solved
- Be prepared to handle follow-up questions without losing context
Preamble Explanations
Control when and how GPT-5 explains its actions:

For transparency without verbosity:

Every so often, explain notable actions you're taking - not before every step, 
but when making significant progress or determining key next steps.
For detailed explanations:

Before each major action, briefly explain why you're taking that approach.
Parallel Processing
GPT-5 can handle multiple tasks simultaneously when properly instructed:

You can process multiple independent tasks in parallel when there's no conflict.
For example, you can simultaneously:
- Research multiple topics
- Analyze different data sets
- Generate various content pieces
Avoid parallel processing only when tasks depend on each other's outputs.
Best Practices for Different Use Cases
Research and Analysis
1. Start with a high-level plan outlining all information sources needed
2. Gather data comprehensively before analysis
3. Present findings in a structured format with clear sections
4. Include a summary of key insights at the beginning or end
Creative Writing
1. Establish tone, style, and voice parameters upfront
2. Create an outline before writing
3. Maintain consistency throughout the piece
4. Review for coherence and flow before finalizing
Problem-Solving
1. Clearly state the problem and constraints
2. Generate multiple solution approaches
3. Evaluate pros and cons of each approach
4. Recommend the optimal solution with justification
Educational Content
1. Assess the audience's knowledge level
2. Structure information from foundational to advanced
3. Include examples and analogies
4. Provide checkpoints for understanding
Advanced Techniques
TODO Tool Implementation
Consider implementing a mental TODO list structure:

Track progress with:
- [ ] Primary objective
- [ ] Sub-task 1
- [ ] Sub-task 2
- [ ] Validation step
- [ ] Final review
Error Prevention
Include validation instructions:

Before providing your final response:
1. Verify all requirements have been addressed
2. Check for internal consistency
3. Ensure the output format matches specifications
4. Confirm no prohibited elements are included
Example Prompt Template
<request>
[Your specific request here]
</request>

<instructions>
1. First, create a brief plan outlining your approach
2. Explain your reasoning for this approach
3. Execute the plan step by step
4. Validate each major output against the requirements
5. Provide a final summary confirming all objectives are met
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Verbosity: [low/medium/high]
- Style: [formal/casual/technical]
- Format: [paragraph/bullet points/structured sections]
</constraints>




               <persistence>
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- Never stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions, as you can always adjust later — decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting
</persistence>


               When asked to optimize prompts, give answers from your own perspective - explain what specific phrases could be added to, or deleted from, this prompt to more consistently elicit the desired behavior or prevent the undesired behavior.
Here's a prompt: [PROMPT]
The desired behavior from this prompt is for the agent to [DO DESIRED BEHAVIOR], but instead it [DOES UNDESIRED BEHAVIOR]. While keeping as much of the existing prompt intact as possible, what are some minimal edits/additions that you would make to encourage the agent to more consistently address these shortcomings?
